### Bonjour and welcome ðŸ‘‹
My name is CÃ©dric Badjah, I'm a web developer.
As you see, I have a lot of repo. I do a lot of things, and usually I try again and again, until I'm satisfied. But I like to keep my bad code (as much as possible) for some reason.
- For laught in the future
- To remember my mistake, and to remember the solution.
- To see my improvements.

There are inevitably projects that matter more than the others and you're right, I put them below, tidy up techno:
