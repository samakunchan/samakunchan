### Bonjour and welcome ðŸ‘‹
My name is CÃ©dric Badjah, I'm a web developer.
As you see, I have a lot of repo. I do a lot of things, and usually I try again and again, until I'm satisfied. But I like to keep my bad code (as much as possible) for some reason.
- For laught in the future
- To remember my mistake, and to remember the solution.
- To see my improvements.

There are inevitably projects that matter more than the others and you're right, I put them below, tidy up techno:
  <details>
    <summary>Angular</summary>
    <br>
    <p>- <a href="https://github.com/samakunchan/devppg-api">Dev PPG API</a>: An api for my future website (private for now)</p>
    <p>- <a href="https://github.com/samakunchan/papangue">Papague</a>: The template of my website</p>
    <p>- <a href="https://github.com/samakunchan/keycloak">Keycloak</a>: For all my authentication</p>
  </details>

    <summary>Symfony</summary>
    <p>- <a href="https://github.com/samakunchan/samatech">Samakunchan Technology</a>: My personal website</p>

  </details>
